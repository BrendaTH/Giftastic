# Giftastic with the Simpsons
### I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. You can't prove anything

The instructions were: 
use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page
Which GIFs and what theme are my choice, but it must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

I did use some jquery, but a lot of my code was done in vanilla JavaScript - to make sure I remembered it :)

The theme was the Simpsons. The app uses a Simpsons like font (rock-salt) found on fonts.googleapis, and I chose primary colors for the backgrounds, fonts, and buttons to reflect the color scheme of the show.

I used bootstrap to layout the jumbotron with background image and buttons.
I used flexbox to layout the gifs. The gifs were of different sizes, so flexbox seemed to lend itself to this task. 

The app is mobile responsive. 
Users may click on any of the premade buttons to get the GIFs for that Simpsons character, or they can make their own buttons.
The app shows each GIF's rating, title, and the character of the button clicked.
