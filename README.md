# Repo Name: Giftastic

## GITHUB Location: https://github.com/BrendaTH/Giftastic

## Operation:
This uses the Gif API to fetch and display gifs. The theme is The Simpsons. There are several already made buttons with Simpson character names, and there is an input form for users to create their own character buttons. When a button is selected 10 gifs with that character are fetched and displayed along with the gif rating, title, and character name.
This was for week 6 homework assignment. The instructions were: 
* use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page
* which GIFs and what theme are my choice, but it must call the GIPHY API to fetch 10 gifs.
* use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

I did use some jquery, but a lot of my code was done in vanilla JavaScript - to make sure I remembered it :)

## Technology used: 
* The theme was the Simpsons. The app uses a Simpsons like font (rock-salt) found on fonts.googleapis, and I chose primary colors for the backgrounds, fonts, and buttons to reflect the color scheme of the show.
* AJAX is used to fetch the Gifs.
* I used bootstrap to layout the jumbotron with background image and buttons.
* I used flexbox to layout the gifs. The gifs were of different sizes, so flexbox seemed to lend itself to this task. 
* The app is mobile responsive.
